Introduction to Model Processing
================================

:target:`doxid-openvino_docs_model_processing_introduction_1md_openvino_docs_documentation_model_introduction` Every deep learning workflow begins with obtaining a model. You can choose to prepare a custom one, use a ready-made solution and adjust it to your needs, or even download and run a pre-trained network from an online database, such as OpenVINO's :ref:`Open Model Zoo <doxid-model_zoo>`.

This section describes how to obtain and prepare your model for work with OpenVINO to get the best inference results:

* :ref:`Browse a database of models for use in your projects <doxid-model_zoo>`.

* :ref:`Convert different model formats to the OpenVINO IR format <doxid-openvino_docs__m_o__d_g__deep__learning__model__optimizer__dev_guide>`.

* `Automate model-related tasks with Model Downloader and additional OMZ Tools <https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/omz_tools_downloader.html>`__.
