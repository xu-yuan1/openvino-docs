Benchmark C++ Tool
==================

:target:`doxid-openvino_inference_engine_samples_benchmark_app__r_e_a_d_m_e_1md_openvino_samples_cpp_benchmark_app_readme` 

This topic demonstrates how to use the Benchmark C++ Tool to estimate deep 
learning inference performance on supported devices. Performance can be 
measured for two inference modes: latency- and throughput-oriented.

.. note:: This topic describes usage of C++ implementation of the Benchmark 
   Tool. For the Python implementation, refer to 
   :ref:`Benchmark Python Tool <doxid-openvino_inference_engine_tools_benchmark_tool__r_e_a_d_m_e>`.

How It Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upon start-up, the application reads command-line parameters and loads a 
network and inputs (images/binary files) to the specified device.

.. note:: By default, OpenVINOâ„¢ Toolkit Samples, Tools and Demos expect input 
   with BGR channels order. If you trained your model to work with RGB order, 
   you need to manually rearrange the default channels order in the sample or 
   demo application or reconvert your model using the Model Optimizer tool with 
   ``--reverse_input_channels`` argument specified. For more information about 
   the argument, refer to **When to Reverse Input Channels** section of 
   :ref:`Embedding Preprocessing Computation <doxid-openvino_docs__m_o__d_g_prepare_model_convert_model__converting__model>`.

Device-specific execution parameters (number of streams, threads, and so on) 
can be either explicitly specified through the command line or left default. In 
the last case, the sample logic will select the values for the optimal 
throughput. While experimenting with individual parameters allows to find the 
performance sweet spot, usually, the parameters are not very 
performance-portable, so the values from one machine or device are not 
necessarily optimal for another. From this perspective, the most portable way 
is experimenting only with the performance hints. To learn more, refer to the 
section on the command-line parameters below.

A number of execution steps is defined by one of the following parameters:

* Number of iterations specified with the ``-niter`` command-line argument

* Time duration specified with the ``-t`` command-line argument

* Both of them (execution will continue until both conditions are met)

* Predefined duration if ``-niter`` and ``-t`` are not specified. Predefined 
  duration value depends on a device.

During the execution, the application calculates latency (if applicable) and 
overall throughput:

* By default, the median latency value is reported

* Throughput is calculated as overall_inference_time/number_of_processed_requests. 
  Note that the throughput value also depends on batch size.

The application also collects per-layer Performance Measurement (PM) counters 
for each executed infer request if you enable statistics dumping by setting the 
``-report_type`` parameter to one of the possible values:

* ``no_counters`` report includes configuration options specified, resulting FPS
   and latency.

* ``average_counters`` report extends the ``no_counters`` report and 
  additionally includes average PM counters values for each layer from the network.

* ``detailed_counters`` report extends the ``average_counters`` report and 
  additionally includes per-layer PM counters and latency for each executed 
  infer request.

Depending on the type, the report is stored to 
``benchmark_no_counters_report.csv``, ``benchmark_average_counters_report.csv``, 
or ``benchmark_detailed_counters_report.csv`` file located in the path 
specified in ``-report_folder``.

The application also saves executable graph information serialized to an XML 
file if you specify a path to it with the ``-exec_graph_path`` parameter.

Run the Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that the ``benchmark_app`` usually produces optimal performance for any 
device out of the box. **So in most cases you do not need to play the app 
options explicitly and the plain device name is enough**, for example, for CPU:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

   ./benchmark_app -m <model> -i <input> -d CPU

But it is still may be sub-optimal for some cases, especially for very small 
networks. More details can read in :ref:`Performance Optimization Guide <performance_optimization_guide_introduction>`.

As explained in the :ref:`Performance Optimization Guide <performance_optimization_guide_introduction>` 
section, for all devices, including new :ref:`MULTI device <deploy_infer__multi_plugin>` 
it is preferable to use the FP16 IR for the model. Also if latency of the CPU 
inference on the multi-socket machines is of concern, please refer to the same 
:ref:`Performance Optimization Guide <performance_optimization_guide_introduction>`.

Running the application with the ``-h`` option yields the following usage message:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

   ./benchmark_app -h

   benchmark_app [OPTION]
   Options:

       -h, --help                Print a usage message

                                 In case of dynamic shapes networks with several inputs provide the same number of files for each input (except cases with single file for any input):"input1:1.jpg input2:1.bin", "input1:1.bin,2.bin input2:3.bin input3:4.bin,5.bin ". Also you can pass specific keys for inputs: "random" - for fillling input with random data, "image_info" - for filling input with image size.
                                 You should specify either one files set to be used for all inputs (without providing input names) or separate files sets for every input of model (providing inputs names).
       -d "<device>"             Optional. Specify a target device to infer on (the list of available devices is shown below). Default value is CPU. Use "-d HETERO:<comma-separated_devices_list>" format to specify HETERO plugin. Use "-d MULTI:<comma-separated_devices_list>" format to specify MULTI plugin. The application looks for a suitable plugin for the specified device.
       -extensions "<absolute_path>" Required for custom layers (extensions). Absolute path to a shared library with the kernels implementations.
             Or
       -c "<absolute_path>"      Required for GPU custom kernels. Absolute path to an .xml file with the kernels description.
       -hint "performance hint (latency or throughput or cumulative_throughput or none)"   Optional. Performance hint allows the OpenVINO device to select the right network-specific settings.

       -progress                 Optional. Show progress bar (can affect performance measurement). Default values is "false".
       -shape                    Optional. Set shape for network input. For example, "input1[1,3,224,224],input2[1,4]" or "[1,3,224,224]" in case of one input size. This parameter affect model input shape and can be dynamic. For dynamic dimensions use symbol `?` or '-1'. Ex. [?,3,?,?]. For bounded dimensions specify range 'min..max'. Ex. [1..10,3,?,?].
       -data_shape               Required for networks with dynamic shapes. Set shape for input blobs. In case of one input size: "[1,3,224,224]" or "input1[1,3,224,224],input2[1,4]". In case of several input sizes provide the same number for each input (except cases with single shape for any input): "[1,3,128,128][3,3,128,128][1,3,320,320]", "input1[1,1,128,128][1,1,256,256],input2[80,1]" or "input1[1,192][1,384],input2[1,192][1,384],input3[1,192][1,384],input4[1,192][1,384]". If network shapes are all static specifying the option will cause an exception.

Number of streams to use for inference on the CPU, GPU or MYRIAD devices (for HETERO and MULTI device cases use format <dev1>:<nstreams1>,<dev2>:<nstreams2> or just <nstreams>). Default value is determined automatically for a device.Please note that although the automatic selection usually provides a reasonable performance, it still may be non - optimal for some cases, especially for very small networks. See sample's README for more details. Also, using nstreams>1 is inherently throughput-oriented option, while for the best-latency estimations the number of streams should be set to 1.
       -nthreads "<integer>"     Optional. Number of threads to use for inference on the CPU (including HETERO and MULTI cases).

Running the application with the empty list of options yields the usage message 
given above and an error message.

Application supports topologies with one or more inputs. If a topology is not 
data-sensitive, you can skip the input parameter. In this case, inputs are 
filled with random values. If a model has only image input(s), please provide a 
folder with images or a path to an image as input. If a model has some specific 
input(s) (not images), please prepare a binary file(s) that is filled with data 
of appropriate precision and provide a path to them as input. If a model has 
mixed input types, input folder should contain all required files. Image inputs 
are filled with image files one by one. Binary inputs are filled with binary 
inputs one by one.

To run the tool, you can use public or Intel's pre-trained models from the Open 
Model Zoo. The models can be downloaded using the Model Downloader.

.. note:: Before running the tool with a trained model, make sure the model is 
   converted to the OpenVINO IR (\*.xml + \*.bin) using the 
   :ref:`Model Optimizer tool <doxid-openvino_docs__m_o__d_g__deep__learning__model__optimizer__dev_guide>`.

The sample accepts models in ONNX format (.onnx) that do not require 
preprocessing.

Examples of Running the Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides step-by-step instructions on how to run the Benchmark 
Tool with the ``googlenet-v1`` public model on CPU or GPU devices. The 
`dog.bmp <https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/data/test_data/images/224x224/dog.bmp>`__ 
file is used as an input.

.. note:: The Internet access is required to execute the following steps 
   successfully. If you have access to the Internet through the proxy server 
   only,  make sure that it is configured in your OS environment.

#. Install OpenVINO Development Tools to work with Caffe models:

   .. ref-code-block:: cpp

      pip install openvino-dev[caffe]

#. Download the model. Go to the Model Downloader directory and run the 
   ``omz_downloader`` script with specifying the model name and directory to 
   download the model to:

   .. ref-code-block:: cpp

      omz_downloader --name googlenet-v1 -o <models_dir>

#. Convert the model to the OpenVINO IR format. Run the Model Optimizer using 
the ``mo`` command with the path to the model, model format and output 
to generate the IR files:

   .. ref-code-block:: cpp

      mo --input_model <models_dir>/public/googlenet-v1/googlenet-v1.caffemodel --data_type FP32 --output_dir <ir_dir>

#. Run the tool with specifying the ``dog.bmp`` file as an input image, the IR 
   of the ``googlenet-v1`` model and a device to perform inference on. The 
   following commands demonstrate running the Benchmark Tool in the 
   asynchronous mode on CPU and GPU devices:

   * On CPU:

     .. ref-code-block:: cpp

        ./benchmark_app -m <ir_dir>/googlenet-v1.xml -i dog.bmp  -d CPU -api async -progress

   * On GPU:

     .. ref-code-block:: cpp

        ./benchmark_app -m <ir_dir>/googlenet-v1.xml -i dog.bmp -d GPU -api async -progress

The application outputs the number of executed iterations, total duration of 
execution, latency, and throughput. Additionally, if you set the 
``-report_type`` parameter, the application outputs statistics report. If you 
set the ``-pc`` parameter, the application outputs performance counters. If you 
set ``-exec_graph_path``, the application reports executable graph information 
serialized. All measurements including per-layer PM counters are reported in 
milliseconds.
