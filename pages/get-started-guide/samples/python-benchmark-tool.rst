Benchmark Python Tool
=======================

:target:`doxid-openvino_inference_engine_tools_benchmark_tool__r_e_a_d_m_e_1md_openvino_tools_benchmark_tool_readme` This topic demonstrates how to run the Benchmark Python Tool, which performs inference using convolutional networks. Performance can be measured for two inference modes: latency- and throughput-oriented.

.. note:: This topic describes usage of Python implementation of the Benchmark Tool. For the C++ implementation, refer to :ref:`Benchmark C++ Tool <doxid-openvino_inference_engine_samples_benchmark_app__r_e_a_d_m_e>`.





How It Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upon start-up, the application reads command-line parameters and loads a network and inputs (images/binary files) to the specified device. Device-specific execution parameters (number of streams, threads, and so on) can be either explicitly specified through the command line or left default. In the latter case, the sample logic will select the values for the optimal throughput. While further experimenting with individual parameters (like number of streams and requests, batch size, etc) allows to find the performance sweet spot, usually, the resulting values are not very performance-portable, so the values from one machine or device are not necessarily optimal for another. From this perspective, the most portable way is experimenting only the performance hints. To learn more, refer to the section below.

.. note:: By default, OpenVINO samples, tools and demos expect input with BGR 
   channels order. If you trained your model to work with RGB order, you need 
   to manually rearrange the default channels order in the sample or demo 
   application or reconvert your model using the Model Optimizer tool with 
   ``--reverse_input_channels`` argument specified. For more information about 
   the argument, refer to **When to Reverse Input Channels** section of 
   :ref:`Converting a Model to Intermediate Representation (IR) <doxid-openvino_docs__m_o__d_g_prepare_model_convert_model__converting__model>`.





Latency and Throughput-focused Inference Modes
----------------------------------------------

In many cases the primary performance metric is the time (in milliseconds) for an individual inference request. For conventional devices the best latency is usually achieved when the application operates single inference request. Similarly, while for some devices the synchronous API (``Infer`` method) was slightly better for the latency. However, advanced devices like multi-socket CPUs, modern GPUs and so on, are capable to run multiple inference requests, while delivering the same latency (as with the single request). Also, the asynchronous API is more general/flexible (with respect to handling multiple inference requests). Overall, the legacy way of measuring latency (triggered by '-api sync') with a single request and synchronous API is discouraged in favor of the dedicated '-hint latency' that lets the *device* to apply the right settings to minimize the time to request.

Throughput-oriented scenarios, in contrast, are focused on fully saturating the machine with enough data to crunch, as opposite to the time of the individual request. So, the primary performance metric is rather FPS (frames per second). Yet, just like with the latency case, the optimal execution parameters may differ between machines and devices. So, again, as explained in the previous section, the most portable way is to use the dedicated performance hint, rather than playing individual parameters. The hints allow the device to configure actual settings for the specified mode. The sample then queries/executes the optimal number of inference requests.

During the execution, the application collects/reports two types of metrics:

* Wall-clock time (latency) of each infer request and resulting latency

* Duration of all inference executions and resulting throughput By default, the reported latency value is always calculated as the median (i.e. 50th percentile) value of all collected latencies from individual requests. Notice that you can change the desired percentile with the command-line flag. The throughput value is derived from the overall inference execution time and number of completed requests (respecting the batch size).

Defining the Number of Inference Executions
-------------------------------------------

A number of executions is defined by one of the two values:

* Explicitly, with the ``-niter`` command-line argument

* As *time* duration specified with the ``-t`` command-line argument

* Both of them (execution will continue until both conditions are met)

* Predefined duration if neither ``-niter`` nor ``-t`` are not specified. Predefined duration value depends on the device.

Run the Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before running the Benchmark tool, install :ref:`OpenVINOâ„¢ Development Tools <doxid-openvino_docs_install_guides_install_dev_tools>`.

Notice that the benchmark_app usually produces optimal performance for any device out of the box. **So in most cases you don't need to play the app options explicitly and the plain device name is enough**, for example, for CPU:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

	benchmark_app -m <model> -i <input> -d CPU

But it is still may be sub-optimal for some cases, especially for very small networks. More details can read in :ref:`Performance Optimization Guide <performance_optimization_guide_introduction>`.

Running the application with the ``-h`` or ``--help`` ' option yields the following usage message:

Application supports topologies with one or more inputs. If a topology is not data sensitive, you can skip the input parameter. In this case, inputs are filled with random values. If a model has only image input(s), please a provide folder with images or a path to an image as input. If a model has some specific input(s) (not images), please prepare a binary file(s), which is filled with data of appropriate precision and provide a path to them as input. If a model has mixed input types, input folder should contain all required files. Image inputs are filled with image files one by one. Binary inputs are filled with binary inputs one by one.

To run the tool, you can use public or Intel's pre-trained models from the Open Model Zoo. The models can be downloaded using the Model Downloader.

.. note:: Before running the tool with a trained model, make sure the model is 
   converted to the OpenVINO format (\*.xml + \*.bin) using the 
   :ref:`Model Optimizer tool <doxid-openvino_docs__m_o__d_g__deep__learning__model__optimizer__dev_guide>`.





Examples of Running the Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides step-by-step instructions on how to run the Benchmark Tool with the ``googlenet-v1`` public model on CPU or GPU devices. The `dog.bmp <https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/data/test_data/images/224x224/dog.bmp>`__ file is used as an input.

.. note:: The Internet access is required to execute the following steps successfully. 
   If you have access to the Internet through the proxy server only, please make 
   sure that it is configured in your OS environment.





#. Install OpenVINO Development Tools to work with Caffe models:
   
   .. ref-code-block:: cpp
   
   	pip install openvino-dev[caffe]

#. Download the model. Go to the Model Downloader directory and run the ``omz_downloader`` tool with the model name and directory to download the model to:
   
   .. ref-code-block:: cpp
   
   	omz_downloader --name googlenet-v1 -o <models_dir>

#. Convert the model to the OpenVINO IR format. Run Model Optimizer with the path to the model, model format and output directory to generate the IR files:
   
   .. ref-code-block:: cpp
   
   	mo --input_model <models_dir>/public/googlenet-v1/googlenet-v1.caffemodel --data_type FP32 --output_dir <ir_dir>

#. Run the tool with specifying the ``dog.bmp`` file as an input image, the IR of the ``googlenet-v1`` model and a device to perform inference on. The following commands demonstrate running the Benchmark Tool in the asynchronous mode on CPU and GPU devices:
   
   * On CPU:
     
     .. ref-code-block:: cpp
     
     	benchmark_app -m <ir_dir>/googlenet-v1.xml -d CPU -api async -i dog.bmp -progress -b 1
   
   * On GPU:
     
     .. ref-code-block:: cpp
     
     	benchmark_app -m <ir_dir>/googlenet-v1.xml -d GPU -api async -i dog.bmp -progress -b 1

The application outputs number of executed iterations, total duration of execution, latency and throughput. Additionally, if you set the ``-pc`` parameter, the application outputs performance counters. If you set ``-exec_graph_path``, the application reports executable graph information serialized.
