Deep Learning Workbench (DL Workbench) is an official OpenVINO™ graphical interface designed to make the production of pretrained deep learning Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing models significantly easier.

Minimize the inference-to-deployment workflow timing for neural models right in your browser: import a model, analyze its performance and accuracy, visualize the outputs, optimize and make the final model deployment-ready in a matter of minutes. DL Workbench takes you through the full OpenVINO™ workflow, providing the opportunity to learn about various toolkit components.

DL Workbench enables you to get a detailed performance assessment, explore inference configurations, and obtain an optimized model ready to be deployed on various Intel® configurations, such as client and server CPU, Intel® Processor Graphics (GPU), Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS 2), and Intel® Vision Accelerator Design with Intel® Movidius™ VPUs.

DL Workbench also provides the `JupyterLab environment <https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/workbench_docs_Workbench_DG_Jupyter_Notebooks.html#doxid-workbench-docs-workbench-d-g-jupyter-notebooks>`__ that helps you quick start with OpenVINO™ API and command-line interface (CLI). Follow the full OpenVINO workflow created for your model and learn about different toolkit components.

User Goals
~~~~~~~~~~

DL Workbench helps achieve your goals depending on the stage of your deep learning journey.

If you are a beginner in the deep learning field, the DL Workbench provides you with learning opportunities:

* Learn what neural networks are, how they work, and how to examine their architectures.

* Learn the basics of neural network analysis and optimization before production.

* Get familiar with the OpenVINO™ ecosystem and its main components without installing it on your system.

If you have enough experience with neural networks, DL Workbench provides you with a convenient web interface to optimize your model and prepare it for production:

* Measure and interpret model performance.

* Tune the model for enhanced performance.

* Analyze the quality of your model and visualize output.
