Introduction to Model Processing
================================

:target:`conv_prep__model_processing_intro_1md_openvino_docs_documentation_model_introduction` 

Every deep learning workflow begins with obtaining a model. You can choose to 
prepare a custom one, use a ready-made solution and adjust it to your needs, 
or even download and run a pre-trained network from an online database, such 
as OpenVINO's :ref:`Open Model Zoo <doxid-model_zoo>`.

This section describes how to obtain and prepare your model for work with 
OpenVINO to get the best inference results:

* :ref:`Browse a database of models for use in your projects <doxid-model_zoo>`.

* :ref:`Convert different model formats to the OpenVINO IR format <conv_prep__conv_with_model_optimizer>`.

* `Automate model-related tasks with Model Downloader and additional OMZ Tools <https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/omz_tools_downloader.html>`__.
