The `Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/openvino-toolkit.html>`__ 
helps accelerate deep learning inference across a variety of Intel® processors 
and accelerators.

The benchmark results below demonstrate high performance gains on several public 
neural networks on multiple Intel® CPUs, GPUs and VPUs covering a broad performance 
range. The results may be helpful when deciding which hardware is best for your 
applications and solutions or to plan AI workload on the Intel computing already 
included in your solutions.

The following benchmarks are available:

* :ref:`Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit Benchmark Results <openvino_benchmarks>`.

* :ref:`OpenVINO™ Model Server Benchmark Results <ovms_benchmarks>`.

Performance of a particular application can also be evaluated virtually using 
`Intel® DevCloud for the Edge <https://devcloud.intel.com/edge/>`__. It is a 
remote development environment with access to Intel® hardware and the latest 
versions of the Intel® Distribution of the OpenVINO™ Toolkit. To learn more 
about it, visit `the website <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/devcloud/edge/overview.html>`__ 
or `create an account <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/forms/idz/devcloud-registration.html?tgt=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/secure/forms/devcloud-enrollment/account-provisioning.html>`__.
