The `Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/openvino-toolkit.html>`__ 
helps accelerate deep learning inference across a variety of Intel® processors 
and accelerators.

The benchmark results in this section demonstrate high performance gains on several public 
neural networks on multiple Intel® CPUs, GPUs and VPUs, covering a broad performance 
range. It may help to decide which hardware is best for your solutions or predict 
the AI workload for the Intel hardware you already have.

The following benchmarks are available:

* :ref:`Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit Benchmark Results <optim_perf__openvino_benchmarks>`.

* :ref:`OpenVINO™ Model Server Benchmark Results <optim_perf__ovms_benchmarks>`.

You can also download the full :download:`Performance Data Spreadsheet (XLSX) <./_assets/OVbenchmark_summary_2022.1.xlsx>`. 


Performance of a particular application can also be evaluated virtually using 
`Intel® DevCloud for the Edge <https://devcloud.intel.com/edge/>`__. It is a 
remote development environment with access to Intel® hardware and the latest 
versions of the Intel® Distribution of the OpenVINO™ Toolkit. To learn more 
about it, visit `the website <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/devcloud/edge/overview.html>`__
