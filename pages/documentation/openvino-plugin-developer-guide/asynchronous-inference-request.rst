Asynchronous Inference Request
==============================

:target:`doxid-openvino_docs_ie_plugin_dg_async_infer_request_1md_openvino_docs_ie_plugin_dg_asyncinferrequest` Asynchronous Inference Request runs an inference pipeline asynchronously in one or several task executors depending on a device pipeline structure. OpenVINO Runtime Plugin API provides the base :ref:`InferenceEngine::AsyncInferRequestThreadSafeDefault <doxid-class_inference_engine_1_1_async_infer_request_thread_safe_default>` class:

* The class has the ``_pipeline`` field of ``std::vector<std::pair<ITaskExecutor::Ptr, Task> >``, which contains pairs of an executor and executed task.

* All executors are passed as arguments to a class constructor and they are in the running state and ready to run tasks.

* The class has the :ref:`InferenceEngine::AsyncInferRequestThreadSafeDefault::StopAndWait <doxid-class_inference_engine_1_1_async_infer_request_thread_safe_default_1ad09f77f1467a13083e5f1a0eba1948b6>` method, which waits for ``_pipeline`` to finish in a class destructor. The method does not stop task executors and they are still in the running stage, because they belong to the executable network instance and are not destroyed.

OpenVINO Runtime Plugin API provides the base :ref:`InferenceEngine::AsyncInferRequestThreadSafeDefault <doxid-class_inference_engine_1_1_async_infer_request_thread_safe_default>` class for a custom asynchronous inference request implementation:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

	class TemplateAsyncInferRequest : public :ref:`InferenceEngine::AsyncInferRequestThreadSafeDefault <doxid-class_inference_engine_1_1_async_infer_request_thread_safe_default>` {
	public:
	    TemplateAsyncInferRequest(const TemplateInferRequest::Ptr& inferRequest,
	                              const :ref:`InferenceEngine::ITaskExecutor::Ptr <doxid-class_inference_engine_1_1_i_task_executor_1a8ba60f739a36331eb8ed3492ffc55eb5>`& taskExecutor,
	                              const :ref:`InferenceEngine::ITaskExecutor::Ptr <doxid-class_inference_engine_1_1_i_task_executor_1a8ba60f739a36331eb8ed3492ffc55eb5>`& waitExecutor,
	                              const :ref:`InferenceEngine::ITaskExecutor::Ptr <doxid-class_inference_engine_1_1_i_task_executor_1a8ba60f739a36331eb8ed3492ffc55eb5>`& callbackExecutor);
	
	    ~TemplateAsyncInferRequest();
	
	private:
	    TemplateInferRequest::Ptr _inferRequest;
	    :ref:`InferenceEngine::ITaskExecutor::Ptr <doxid-class_inference_engine_1_1_i_task_executor_1a8ba60f739a36331eb8ed3492ffc55eb5>` _waitExecutor;
	};

Class Fields
++++++++++++

* ``_inferRequest`` - a reference to the :ref:`synchronous inference request <doxid-openvino_docs_ie_plugin_dg_infer_request>` implementation. Its methods are reused in the ``AsyncInferRequest`` constructor to define a device pipeline.

* ``_waitExecutor`` - a task executor that waits for a response from a device about device tasks completion

.. note:: If a plugin can work with several instances of a device, ``_waitExecutor`` must be device-specific. Otherwise, having a single task executor for several devices does not allow them to work in parallel.





.. rubric::

The main goal of the ``AsyncInferRequest`` constructor is to define a device pipeline ``_pipeline``. The example below demonstrates ``_pipeline`` creation with the following stages:

* ``inferPreprocess`` is a CPU compute task.

* ``startPipeline`` is a CPU ligthweight task to submit tasks to a remote device.

* ``waitPipeline`` is a CPU non-compute task that waits for a response from a remote device.

* ``inferPostprocess`` is a CPU compute task.

	    : AsyncInferRequestThreadSafeDefault(inferRequest, cpuTaskExecutor, callbackExecutor),

	      _waitExecutor(waitExecutor) {
	    // In current implementation we have CPU only tasks and no needs in 2 executors
	    // So, by default single stage pipeline is created.
	    // This stage executes InferRequest::Infer() using cpuTaskExecutor.
	    // But if remote asynchronous device is used the pipeline can by splitted tasks that are executed by cpuTaskExecutor

	    constexpr const auto remoteDevice = false;
	
	    if (remoteDevice) {
	        _pipeline = {{cpuTaskExecutor,
	                      [this] {
	                          :ref:`OV_ITT_SCOPED_TASK <doxid-group__ie__dev__profiling_1gac1e4b5bdc6097e2afd26b75d05dfe1ef>`(itt::domains::TemplatePlugin,
	                                             "TemplateAsyncInferRequest::PreprocessingAndStartPipeline");
	                          _inferRequest->inferPreprocess();
	                          _inferRequest->startPipeline();
	                      }},
	                     {_waitExecutor,
	                      [this] {
	                          :ref:`OV_ITT_SCOPED_TASK <doxid-group__ie__dev__profiling_1gac1e4b5bdc6097e2afd26b75d05dfe1ef>`(itt::domains::TemplatePlugin, "TemplateAsyncInferRequest::WaitPipeline");
	                          _inferRequest->waitPipeline();
	                      }},
	                     {cpuTaskExecutor, [this] {
	                          :ref:`OV_ITT_SCOPED_TASK <doxid-group__ie__dev__profiling_1gac1e4b5bdc6097e2afd26b75d05dfe1ef>`(itt::domains::TemplatePlugin, "TemplateAsyncInferRequest::Postprocessing");
	                          _inferRequest->inferPostprocess();
	                      }}};
	    }
	}

The stages are distributed among two task executors in the following way:

* ``inferPreprocess`` and ``startPipeline`` are combined into a single task and run on ``_requestExecutor``, which computes CPU tasks.

* You need at least two executors to overlap compute tasks of a CPU and a remote device the plugin works with. Otherwise, CPU and device tasks are executed serially one by one.

* ``waitPipeline`` is sent to ``_waitExecutor``, which works with the device.

.. note:: ``callbackExecutor`` is also passed to the constructor and it is used in the base :ref:`InferenceEngine::AsyncInferRequestThreadSafeDefault <doxid-class_inference_engine_1_1_async_infer_request_thread_safe_default>` class, which adds a pair of ``callbackExecutor`` and a callback function set by the user to the end of the pipeline.



Inference request stages are also profiled using IE_PROFILING_AUTO_SCOPE, which shows how pipelines of multiple asynchronous inference requests are run in parallel via the `Intel® VTune™ Profiler <https://software.intel.com/en-us/vtune>`__ tool.

.. rubric::

In the asynchronous request destructor, it is necessary to wait for a pipeline to finish. It can be done using the :ref:`InferenceEngine::AsyncInferRequestThreadSafeDefault::StopAndWait <doxid-class_inference_engine_1_1_async_infer_request_thread_safe_default_1ad09f77f1467a13083e5f1a0eba1948b6>` method of the base class.

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

	TemplateAsyncInferRequest::~TemplateAsyncInferRequest() {
	    :ref:`InferenceEngine::AsyncInferRequestThreadSafeDefault::StopAndWait <doxid-class_inference_engine_1_1_async_infer_request_thread_safe_default_1ad09f77f1467a13083e5f1a0eba1948b6>`();
	}
