Plugin Testing
==============

:target:`extensibility_plugin__testing_1md_openvino_docs_ie_plugin_dg_plugintesting` 

Inference Engine (IE) tests infrastructure provides a predefined set of functional 
tests and utilities. They are used to verify a plugin using the Inference Engine 
public API. All the tests are written in the 
`Google Test C++ framework <https://github.com/google/googletest>`__.

Inference Engine Plugin tests are included in the ``IE::funcSharedTests`` CMake 
target which is built within the OpenVINO repository 
(see :ref:`Build Plugin Using CMake <extensibility_plugin__cmake>` 
guide). This library contains tests definitions (the tests bodies) which can be 
parametrized and instantiated in plugins depending on whether a plugin supports 
a particular feature, specific sets of parameters for test on supported operation 
set and so on.

Test definitions are split into tests class declaration 
(see ``inference_engine/tests/functional/plugin/shared/include``) and tests class 
implementation (see ``inference_engine/tests/functional/plugin/shared/src``) and 
include the following scopes of plugin conformance tests:

#. **Behavior tests** (``behavior`` sub-folder), which are a separate test group 
   to check that a plugin satisfies basic Inference Engine concepts: plugin 
   creation, multiple executable networks support, multiple synchronous and 
   asynchronous inference requests support, and so on. See the next section with 
   details how to instantiate the tests definition class with plugin-specific parameters.

#. **Single layer tests** (``single_layer_tests`` sub-folder). This groups of 
   tests checks that a particular single layer can be inferenced on a device. 
   An example of test instantiation based on test definition from 
   ``IE::funcSharedTests`` library:

   * From the declaration of convolution test class we can see that it's a 
     parametrized GoogleTest based class with the ``convLayerTestParamsSet`` 
     tuple of parameters:

                LayerTestsUtils::TargetDevice   // Device name
        > convLayerTestParamsSet;

        class ConvolutionLayerTest : public testing::WithParamInterface<convLayerTestParamsSet>,
                                     virtual public LayerTestsUtils::LayerTestsCommon {
        public:
            static std::string getTestCaseName(const testing::TestParamInfo<convLayerTestParamsSet>& obj);

        protected:

#. **Sub-graph tests** (``subgraph_tests`` sub-folder). This group of tests is 
   designed to tests small patterns or combination of layers. E.g. when a 
   particular topology is being enabled in a plugin e.g. TF ResNet-50, there 
   is no need to add the whole topology to test tests. In opposite way, a 
   particular repetitive subgraph or pattern can be extracted from ``ResNet-50`` 
   and added to the tests. The instantiation of the sub-graph tests is done in 
   the same way as for single layer tests.	**Note**, such sub-graphs or patterns 
   for sub-graph tests should be added to ``IE::ngraphFunctions`` library first 
   (this library is a pre-defined set of small ``:ref:`ov::Model <doxid-classov_1_1_model>```) 
   and re-used in sub-graph tests after.

#. **HETERO tests** (``subgraph_tests`` sub-folder) contains tests for ``HETERO`` 
   scenario (manual or automatic affinities settings, tests for ``QueryNetwork``).

#. **Other tests**, which contain tests for other scenarios and has the following 
   types of tests:

   * Tests for execution graph

   * Etc.

To use these tests for your own plugin development, link the ``IE::funcSharedTests`` 
library to your test binary and instantiate required test cases with desired 
parameters values.

.. note:: A plugin may contain its own tests for use cases that are specific to 
   hardware or need to be extensively tested.

To build test binaries together with other build artifacts, use the ``make all`` 
command. For details, see :ref:`Build Plugin Using CMake <extensibility_plugin__cmake>`.

How to Extend Inference Engine Plugin Tests
-------------------------------------------

Inference Engine Plugin tests are open for contribution. Add common test case 
definitions applicable for all plugins to the ``IE::funcSharedTests`` target 
within the OpenVINO repository. Then, any other plugin supporting corresponding 
functionality can instantiate the new test.

All Inference Engine per-layer tests check test layers functionality. They are 
developed using :ref:`ov::Model <doxid-classov_1_1_model>`. as input graphs used 
by tests. In this case, to test a new layer with layer tests, extend the 
``IE::ngraphFunctions`` library, which is also included in the Inference Engine 
Developer package, with a new model. including the corresponding operation.

.. note:: When implementing a new subgraph test, add new single-layer tests for 
   each operation of the subgraph if such test does not exist.
