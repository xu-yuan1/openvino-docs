All data is autosaved in the DevCloud. To use the DL Workbench again, start a new session as described in the **Start a New DL Workbench Session in the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge** section of :ref:`Run DL Workbench in the DevCloud <workbench_install__dev_cloud>`.

-------------------------------------------------------

If you tried to run the DL Workbench as described in :ref:`Run DL Workbench in the DevCloud <workbench_install__dev_cloud>`, but nothing happens when you press **Deep Learning Workbench** from the **Advanced** tab, make sure your browser does not block pop-up windows as it prevents the tab from opening.

.. _login:

Cannot Log In to the DL Workbench in the DevCloud after a Logout
----------------------------------------------------------------

Once you log out of the DL Workbench in the DevCloud from the **Settings** panel, you can no longer log in to the same DL Workbench session and should start a new one as described in the **Start a New DL Workbench Session in the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge** section of :ref:`Run DL Workbench in the DevCloud <workbench_install__dev_cloud>`.

.. _closed-tab:

Accidentally Closed the DL Workbench Tab in the DevCloud
--------------------------------------------------------

If you accidentally closed the tab with the DL Workbench, go to the Jupyter notebook tab and click the **Return to DL Workbench session** link under the **Stop Application** button.
