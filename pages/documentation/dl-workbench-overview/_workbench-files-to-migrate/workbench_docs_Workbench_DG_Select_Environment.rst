Target is a machine that hosts one or several accelerators. Device is a hardware accelerator on which a model is executed. The target can be your local workstation or a remote system. By default, your local target is selected. Learn more about setting up remote targets at the :ref:`Work with Remote Targets <doxid-workbench_docs__workbench__d_g__remote__profiling>` section.

Select a target. This can be your local workstation or a remote target. If you use a remote target, see :ref:`Register Remote Machine <doxid-workbench_docs__workbench__d_g__add__remote__target>`. Select a device from a target or a platform view:

* **Target View**
  
  Use this view when the list with targets is short. Select a target from the list of machines registered in the DL Workbench.

* **Platform View**
  
  Use this view when the list with targets is long. Determine the base platform based on Intel® processors: Core™, Xeon™, or Atom™. Within a platform, choose a combination and an accelerator. To group targets based on a platform, switch to the platform view and select a platform in the **Base Platform** drop-down list:
