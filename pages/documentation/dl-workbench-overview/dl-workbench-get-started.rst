This section introduces the basics of DL Workbench workflow by walking you through the process of importing 
your first model, creating a project, and evaluating the initial performance. To help you get started 
with DL Workbench, this guide uses 
``ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco`` `model <https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/omz_models_model_ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco.html>`__ 
for `object detection <https://machinelearningmastery.com/object-recognition-with-deep-learning/>`__ use case, trained 
with `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`__ framework.

To start exploring DL Workbench capabilities right away, complete the following steps:

#. :ref:`Import Model <doxid-workbench_docs__workbench__d_g__select__model>`

#. :ref:`Create Project <doxid-workbench_docs__workbench__create__project>`

This guide goes step-by-step through the workflow described in the Create Project video. Watch it to learn how to get 
started with DL Workbench:
