Run the DL Workbench in the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge
=========================================================

:target:`doxid-workbench_docs__workbench__d_g__start__d_l__workbench_in__dev_cloud_1md_openvino_workbench_docs_workbench_dg_start_dl_workbench_in_devcloud` `Intel® DevCloud for the Edge <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/devcloud.html>`__ is a computing resource to develop, test, and run your workloads across a range of Intel® CPUs, GPUs, and Movidius™ Myriad™ Vision Processing Units (VPUs). Running the DL Workbench in the DevCloud helps you optimize your model and analyze its performance on various Intel® hardware configurations. DevCloud is available for enterprise developers, independent developers, students, and faculty members.

When running the DL Workbench in the DevCloud, you can use the following DL Workbench features:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Feature
      - Supported
    * - Single and group inference
      - Yes (HDDL plugin is not supported)
    * - INT8 calibration
      - Yes
    * - Accuracy measurements
      - Yes
    * - Model output visualization
      - Yes
    * - Visualization of runtime and Intermediate Representation (IR) graph
      - Yes
    * - Connecting to your remote machine\*\*
      - No
    * - Downloading models from the `Intel Open Model Zoo <https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/omz_models_group_intel.html>`__
      - Yes
    * - Deployment package creation
      - Yes
    * - JupyterLab learning environment
      - No

\*\* *In the DevCloud, you are connecting only to remote machines that are available in it. You cannot work with your local workstation or connect to other machines in your local network.*

.. note:: * Profiling and calibration on DevCloud machines take more time than on a local machine due to the exchange of models, datasets, the job script, and performance data.

* Inference results may insignificantly vary for identical environment configurations. This happens because the same environment in the DevCloud does not mean the same physical machine.

   * - **Run the DL Workbench in the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge**. Duration: 4:10

#. `Register in the DevCloud <https://inteliotgnew.secure.force.com/devcloudsignup>`__. Shortly after the registration, you receive a mail with a link to the home page.

#. Follow the link from the mail. Click **Accept** if you agree to the Terms and Conditions.

#. Select **Optimize** tab and click **Go There** button to access DL Workbench.

#. The Jupyter notebook called ``DLWorkbenchLauncher.ipynb`` opens:
   
   .. image:: ./_assets/jupyterlab_open.png

#. Run **Launch DL Workbench** cell:
   
   .. image:: ./_assets/devcloud_launch.png

#. The **Start Application** button appears.
   
   .. image:: ./_assets/devcloud_cell_2-1.png

#. Once you click the button, the DevCloud starts initializing and loading the DL Workbench.
   
   .. image:: ./_assets/devcloud_cell_3-1.png

#. In about a minute, the link appears under the cell:
   
   .. image:: ./_assets/devcloud_cell_4-1.png

Click this link to open the DL Workbench. Make sure your browser does not block pop-up windows as it prevents the tab from opening:

.. image:: ./_assets/start_page_crop.png

You have started the DL Workbench in the DevCloud. A DL Workbench session in the DevCloud is limited to four hours. Remaining session time is indicated in the upper-right corner of the interface:

.. image:: ./_assets/devcloud_time.png

After four hours, the Docker container with the DL Workbench stops, but your data is autosaved in the DevCloud. To continue working with the DL Workbench, restart the session.
