Optimization in Simplified Mode
===============================

:target:`pot_simplified_mode_1md_openvino_tools_pot_docs_simplifiedmode`

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simplified mode is designed to make data preparation for the model 
optimization process easier. The mode is represented by an implementation of 
Engine interface from the POT API. It allows reading the data from an arbitrary 
folder specified by the user. For more details about POT API, refer to the 
corresponding [description](pot_compression_api_README). Currently, Simplified 
mode is available only for image data in PNG or JPEG formats, stored in a single folder.

.. note:: This mode cannot be used with accuracy-aware methods. There is no 
   way to control accuracy after optimization. Nevertheless, this mode can be 
   helpful to estimate performance benefits when using model optimizations.

Usage
~~~~~

To use the Simplified mode, prepare the data and place it in a separate folder. 
No other files should be present in this folder. There are two options to 
run POT in the Simplified mode:

* Using command-line options only. Here is an example for 8-bit quantization:

  ``pot -q default -m <path_to_xml> -w <path_to_bin> --engine simplified --data-source <path_to_data>``

* To provide more options, use the corresponding ``"engine"`` section in the 
  POT configuration file as follows:

  .. ref-code-block:: cpp

     "engine": {
         "type": "simplified",
         "layout": "NCHW",               // Layout of input data. Supported ["NCHW",
                                         // "NHWC", "CHW", "CWH"] layout
         "data_source": "PATH_TO_SOURCE" // You can specify path to the directory with images 
                                         // Also you can specify template for file names to filter images to load.
                                         // Templates are unix style (this option is valid only in Simplified mode)
     }

A template of configuration file for 8-bit quantization using Simplified mode 
can be found `at the following link <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/tools/pot/configs/simplified_mode_template.json>`__.

For more details about POT usage via CLI, refer to this :ref:`CLI document <pot_cli>`.
