The plugin architecture of the Inference Engine allows to develop and plug 
independent inference solutions dedicated to different devices. Physically, a 
plugin is represented as a dynamic library exporting the single ``CreatePluginEngine`` 
function that allows to create a new plugin instance.

Inference Engine Plugin Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inference Engine plugin dynamic library consists of several main components:

#. :ref:`Plugin class <doxid-openvino_docs_ie_plugin_dg_plugin>` :

   * Provides information about devices of a specific type.

   * Can create an :ref:`executable network <extensibility_plugin__executable_network_functionality>` 
     instance which represents a Neural Network backend specific graph structure 
     for a particular device in opposite to the 
     :ref:`InferenceEngine::ICNNNetwork <doxid-class_inference_engine_1_1_i_c_n_n_network>` 
     interface which is backend-independent.

   * Can import an already compiled graph structure from an input stream to an 
     :ref:`executable network <extensibility_plugin__executable_network_functionality>` object.

#. :ref:`Executable Network class <extensibility_plugin__executable_network_functionality>` :
   
   * Is an execution configuration compiled for a particular device and takes into account its capabilities.
   
   * Holds a reference to a particular device and a task executor for this device.
   
   * Can create several instances of :ref:`Inference Request <extensibility_plugin__synch_inf_req>`.
   
   * Can export an internal backend specific graph structure to an output stream.

#. :ref:`Inference Request class <extensibility_plugin__synch_inf_req>` :
   
   * Runs an inference pipeline serially.
   
   * Can extract performance counters for an inference pipeline execution profiling.

#. :ref:`Asynchronous Inference Request class <extensibility_plugin__async_infer_req>` :
   
   * Wraps the :ref:`Inference Request <extensibility_plugin__synch_inf_req>` 
     class and runs pipeline stages in parallel on several task executors based 
     on a device-specific pipeline structure.

.. note:: 
   This documentation is written based on the ``Template`` plugin, 
   which demonstrates plugin development details. Find the complete code of the 
   ``Template``, which is fully compilable and up-to-date, at 
   ``<openvino source dir>/docs/template_plugin``.
