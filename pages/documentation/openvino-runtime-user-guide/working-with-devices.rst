OpenVINO Runtime also has several execution capabilities which work on top of other devices:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Capability
      - Description
    * - :ref:`Multi-Device execution <deploy_infer__multi_plugin>`
      - Multi-Device enables simultaneous inference of the same model on 
        several devices in parallel.
    * - :ref:`Auto-Device selection <deploy_infer__auto_plugin>`
      - Auto-Device selection enables selecting Intel device for inference 
        automatically.
    * - :ref:`Heterogeneous execution <deploy_infer__hetero_plugin>`
      - Heterogeneous execution enables automatic inference splitting between 
        several devices (for example if a device doesn't `support certain operation <#supported-layers>`__ ).
    * - :ref:`Automatic Batching <deploy_infer__automatic_batching>`
      - Auto-Batching plugin enables the batching (on top of the specified 
        device) that is completely transparent to the application.

Devices similar to the ones used for benchmarking can be accessed, using 
`Intel® DevCloud for the Edge <https://devcloud.intel.com/edge/>`__, a remote 
development environment with access to Intel® hardware and the latest versions 
of the Intel® Distribution of the OpenVINO™ Toolkit.

Enumerating Available Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenVINO Runtime API features dedicated methods of enumerating devices and 
their capabilities. See the :ref:`Hello Query Device C++ Sample <doxid-openvino_inference_engine_samples_hello_query_device__r_e_a_d_m_e>`. 
This is an example output from the sample (truncated to device names only):

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

   ./hello_query_device
   Available devices:
       Device: CPU
   ...
       Device: GPU.0
   ...
       Device: GPU.1
   ...
       Device: HDDL

A simple programmatic way to enumerate the devices and use with the 
multi-device is as follows:

.. tab:: C++

    .. doxygensnippet:: ../../snippets/MULTI2.cpp
       :language: cpp
       :fragment: [part2]

Beyond the typical "CPU", "GPU", "HDDL", and so on, when multiple instances of 
a device are available, the names are more qualified. For example, this is how 
two Intel® Movidius™ Myriad™ X sticks are listed with the hello_query_sample:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

   ...
       Device: MYRIAD.1.2-ma2480
   ...
       Device: MYRIAD.1.4-ma2480

So, the explicit configuration to use both would be 
"MULTI:MYRIAD.1.2-ma2480,MYRIAD.1.4-ma2480". Accordingly, the code that loops 
over all available devices of the "MYRIAD" type only is as follows:

.. tab:: C++

    .. doxygensnippet:: ../../snippets/MULTI3.cpp
       :language: cpp
       :fragment: [part3]
