Optimizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VPU plugins support layer fusion and decomposition.

Layer Fusion
------------

Fusing Rules
++++++++++++

Certain layers can be merged into 'convolution', 'ReLU', and 'Eltwise' layers according to the patterns below:

* Convolution
  
  * Convolution + ReLU → Convolution
  
  * Convolution + Clamp → Convolution
  
  * Convolution + LeakyReLU → Convolution
  
  * Convolution (3x3, stride=1, padding=1) + Pooling (2x2, stride=2, padding=0) → Convolution

* Pooling + ReLU → Pooling

* FullyConnected + ReLU → FullyConnected

* Eltwise
  
  * Eltwise + ReLU → Eltwise
  
  * Eltwise + LeakyReLU → Eltwise
  
  * Eltwise + Clamp → Eltwise

Joining Rules
+++++++++++++

.. note::

   Application of these rules depends on tensor sizes and available resources.



Layers can be joined only when the two conditions below are met:

* Layers are located on topologically independent branches.

* Layers can be executed simultaneously on the same hardware units.

Decomposition Rules
-------------------

* Convolution and Pooling layers are tiled, resulting in the following pattern:
  
  * A ``Split`` layer that splits tensors into tiles
  
  * A set of tiles, optionally with service layers like ``Copy``
  
  * Depending on a tiling scheme, a ``Concatenation`` or ``Sum`` layer that joins all resulting tensors into one and restores the full blob that contains the result of a tiled operation
  
  Names of tiled layers contain the ``@soc=M/N`` part, where ``M`` is the tile number and ``N`` is the number of tiles:
  
  .. image:: ./_assets/yolo_tiny_v1.png

.. note::

   Nominal layers, such as ``Shrink`` and ``Expand``, are not executed.





.. note::

   VPU plugins can add extra layers like ``Copy``.





VPU Common Configuration Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VPU plugins support the configuration parameters listed below. The parameters are passed as ``std::map<std::string, std::string>`` on ``:ref:`InferenceEngine::Core::LoadNetwork <doxid-class_inference_engine_1_1_core_1a7b0b5ab0009abc572762422105b5c666>``` or ``:ref:`InferenceEngine::Core::SetConfig <doxid-class_inference_engine_1_1_core_1a34aa9ac6fb237b634d5bf08b288e88d4>```. When specifying key values as raw strings (when using Python API), omit the ``KEY_`` prefix.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Parameter Name
      - Parameter Values
      - Default
      - Description
    * - ``KEY_VPU_HW_STAGES_OPTIMIZATION``
      - ``YES`` / ``NO``
      - ``YES``
      - Turn on HW stages usage Applicable for Intel Movidius Myriad X and Intel Vision Accelerator Design devices only.
    * - ``KEY_VPU_COMPUTE_LAYOUT``
      - ``VPU_AUTO`` , ``VPU_NCHW`` , ``VPU_NHWC``
      - ``VPU_AUTO``
      - Specify internal input and output layouts for network layers.
    * - ``KEY_VPU_PRINT_RECEIVE_TENSOR_TIME``
      - ``YES`` / ``NO``
      - ``NO``
      - Add device-side time spent waiting for input to PerformanceCounts. See the `Data Transfer Pipelining <#VPU_DATA_TRANSFER_PIPELINING>`__ section for details.
    * - ``KEY_VPU_IGNORE_IR_STATISTIC``
      - ``YES`` / ``NO``
      - ``NO``
      - VPU plugin could use statistic present in IR in order to try to improve calculations precision. This option is enabled to exclude the statistic.
    * - ``KEY_VPU_CUSTOM_LAYERS``
      - path to XML file
      - empty string
      - This option allows passing XML file with custom layers binding. If a layer is present in such file, it will be used during inference even if the layer is natively supported.

.. _VPU_DATA_TRANSFER_PIPELINING:

Data Transfer Pipelining
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MYRIAD plugin tries to pipeline data transfer to/from a device with computations. While one infer request is executed, the data for the next infer request can be uploaded to a device in parallel. The same applies to result downloading.

``KEY_VPU_PRINT_RECEIVE_TENSOR_TIME`` configuration parameter can be used to check the efficiency of current pipelining. The new record in performance counters will show the time that device spent waiting for input before starting the inference. In a perfect pipeline this time should be near zero, which means that the data was already transferred when new inference started.

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**When running inference with the VPU plugin: "[VPU] Cannot convert layer <layer_name> due to unsupported layer type <layer_type>"**

This means that the topology has a layer unsupported by the target VPU plugin. To resolve this issue, the custom layer can be implemented for the target device, using the :ref:`OpenVINO™ Extensibility mechanism <extensibility__api_introduction>`. To quickly get a working prototype, use the heterogeneous scenario with the default fallback policy (see the :ref:`Heterogeneous execution <deploy_infer__hetero_plugin>` section). Use the HETERO mode with a fallback device that supports this layer, for example, CPU: ``HETERO:MYRIAD,CPU``. For a list of VPU-supported layers, see the **Supported Layers** section of the :ref:`Supported Devices <doxid-openvino_docs__o_v__u_g_supported_plugins__supported__devices>` page.

Known Layers Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``ScaleShift`` layer is supported for zero value of ``broadcast`` attribute only.

* ``CTCGreedyDecoder`` layer works with the ``ctc_merge_repeated`` attribute equal to 1.

* ``DetectionOutput`` layer works with zero values of ``interpolate_orientation`` and ``num_orient_classes`` parameters only.

* ``MVN`` layer uses fixed value for ``eps`` parameters (1e-9).

* ``Normalize`` layer uses fixed value for ``eps`` parameters (1e-9) and is supported for zero value of ``across_spatial`` only.

* ``Pad`` layer works only with 4D tensors.
